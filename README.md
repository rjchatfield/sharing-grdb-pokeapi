## Usage

### Basic Setup

```swift
import PokeAPIDatabase

// Create a database connection
let database = try PokeAPIDatabase.makeDatabase()

// Query Pokemon data
let pikachu = try database.read { db in
    try PokeAPIPokemon
        .filter(Column("identifier") == "pikachu")
        .fetchOne(db)
}
```

### Querying Pokemon

```swift
// Get all Pokemon from generation 1
let gen1Pokemon = try database.read { db in
    try PokeAPIPokemon
        .joining(required: PokeAPIPokemonSpecies.self)
        .filter(PokeAPIPokemonSpecies.Columns.generationId == 1)
        .fetchAll(db)
}

// Get Pokemon by type
let firePokemon = try database.read { db in
    try PokeAPIPokemon
        .joining(required: PokeAPIPokemonType.self)
        .joining(required: PokeAPIType.self)
        .filter(PokeAPIType.Columns.identifier == "fire")
        .fetchAll(db)
}
```

### Available Models

The package includes complete models for all PokeAPI entities:

- `PokeAPIPokemon` - Individual Pokemon forms
- `PokeAPIPokemonSpecies` - Base Pokemon species data
- `PokeAPIType` - Pokemon types (Fire, Water, etc.)
- `PokeAPIMove` - Pokemon moves
- `PokeAPIAbility` - Pokemon abilities
- `PokeAPIItem` - Items and berries
- `PokeAPILocation` - Game locations
- And many more...

## Building and Testing

```bash
# Build the package
swift build

# Run tests
swift test
```

## Updating the Database

To update the SQLite database with the latest Pokemon data from the PokeAPI CSV files:

```bash
# Update database with latest CSV data
./scripts/update_database.sh
```

This script will:
- üîí Backup your existing database
- üóÑÔ∏è Create a fresh database from the schema
- üìä Import the latest CSV data (excluding translations and text files)
- üìà Compare changes between old and new databases
- ‚úÖ Verify the update was successful

**Prerequisites:**
- `sqlite3` (usually pre-installed on macOS/Linux)
- `csvs-to-sqlite` - install with `pip install csvs-to-sqlite`

After updating, run the tests to ensure everything still works:
```bash
swift test
```
